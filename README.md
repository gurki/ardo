Abstract
---

In this work we present *ARDO*, a 3D single player video game to demonstrate and evaluate the use of spatialised sound to estimate position and direction of hidden landmarks. 
To this end, we adapt the board game *ORDO*, also known as [*Black Box*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)). 
Instead of shooting light beams into the world, we make use of sound attached to a moving source, which follows the same rules of movement as in the original. 
Ultimately, the user can even shoot sounds recorded by a microphone through the virtual environement and listen, how they behave. 
We found, that this auditory experience triggers joy in most players and after a short time of practice is sufficient to accurately estimate the position of certain landmarks, that influence the sound movement.
